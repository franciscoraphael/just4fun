# Random XKCD
Enjoying random [XKCD comics](https://xkcd.com) while practicing promises.


#### Backlog
- avoid new button press until action had effect
- add a spin while loading new comics
- show more info, like the title, release day, 
- use classes to encapsulate stuff properly
- avoid using w3scholl style, use bootstrap instead
- make the 'alt' work
- remove donut image from code
- create a way to mark a comic as favorite (cookie?)
- create a search for comic (use the metadata and maybe the img2text from Firebase+GoogleCloudVision)
